# Minneapolis Placefinder

Minneapolis Placefinder is a web app created to allow users to find cool places to hang out in Minneapolis. This app allows users to register and login, which is powered by Firebase. They can search for awesome venues in Minneapolis using the Foursquare Places API.

## Getting Started

Minneapolis Placefinder is hosted here: [Minneapolis Placefinder](https://tranquil-bayou-56539.herokuapp.com)

## Features and Future Goals

### Features

The first things users will do when they come to Minneapolis Placefinder is register, or, if they have been to the site before, log in to the app. From there, they are able to search for places in Minneapolis. They can look for food, drinks, coffee, shops, art outdoors, sights, and trending places. A list of up to 50 results will display on the page.

### Future Goals

For Version 2 of Minneapolis Placefinder, there are a couple features that I would like to add. These include:

- Adding venue websites to list of information displayed
- Ability for users to save places that are listed to their profile. This would make a "bucket list" of cool places the user can reference when looking for places to visit.
- Ability to search for venues in places that are not Minneapolis, MN. I would then change the name of the app to "Placefinder".
